/**
 * Resolves the absolute origin used by `metadataBase`, canonical, hreflang, Open Graph
 * and the sitemap.
 *
 * Kept dependency-free on purpose: `data/site.ts` reaches this module, and `error.tsx`
 * is a Client Component that imports `data/site.ts`, so anything pulled in here also
 * lands in the client bundle. No Zod, no URL helpers beyond the platform.
 *
 * The production build **fails** on a missing or non-HTTPS value rather than falling
 * back. Pages are prerendered as static HTML, so the origin is baked into canonical
 * and hreflang at build time — a wrong value cannot be corrected at runtime, and a
 * silent localhost fallback ships a canonical pointing at an unreachable host.
